Dataset

The dataset contains 1622 pieces of short jokes.

Task to be done

Try to train a RNN model, which can generate the whole piece of jokes based a given input of the beginning three words.

For instance, given three input words “what”, “did”, “the” to your model, we expect your model can generate the whole piece of the joke shown as follows

“what did the bartender say to the jumper cables? You better not try to start anything.”

In the report, please provide some examples your model can generate based on the three starting words that exist in the dataset.

You can also randomly given any three words in your mind (that don’t necessary exist in the dataset), and check what your model can generate.
